# Spring-MVC-JPA

This project demonstrates the use of Spring MVC along with Java Persistence API (JPA) for database operations and Hibernate for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). It provides a seamless backend integration for managing and querying data, featuring three main entities: Instructor, Address, and Course. Liquibase is used for database schema management, and Postman is utilized as a client for testing the API.

## üöÄ Features

- *Create, Read, Update, and Delete* operations for Instructor, Address, and Course entities.
- *MVC architecture* for clear separation of concerns.
- *Spring Boot* for backend development with automatic configuration and dependency management.
- *JPA & Hibernate* for efficient ORM and database interactions.
- *Thymeleaf* for rendering dynamic web pages.
- *Liquibase* for database versioning and migrations.
- *Postman* for testing API endpoints.

Explore the powerful features of this project:

### 1. *Create*

Add new Instructor, Address, or Course entities through a user-friendly web form.

### 2. *Read*

Retrieve and display data for Instructor, Address, or Course entities in a structured format.

### 3. *Update*

## ‚ú® Getting Started

### Step 1: Create a Spring Boot Project

Generate a new Spring Boot project using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) with the following settings:

- Project: Maven Project
- Language: Java
- Spring Boot: Latest stable version
- Packaging: Jar
- Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Thymeleaf, Liquibase, MySQL Driver

Click "Generate" to download the project zip file.

### Step 2: Extract and Import into IDE

Extract the downloaded zip file and import the project into your preferred IDE.

### Step 3: Configure Database and Liquibase

- *Database Configuration*: Update `application.properties` or `application.yml` with your database connection details.
- *Liquibase Configuration*: Configure Liquibase in your `application.properties` and add your changelog files in `src/main/resources/db/changelog`.

### Step 4: Define Entities

Create entity classes for Instructor, Address, and Course in your project.

### Step 5: Create Repository Interfaces

Create repository interfaces for each entity to perform CRUD operations.

### Step 6: Implement Service Layer

Implement a service layer to handle business logic and interact with repositories.

### Step 7: Implement Controllers

Create MVC controllers to handle HTTP requests and return appropriate views.

### Step 8: Create Thymeleaf Views

Develop Thymeleaf templates for displaying forms and results.

### Step 9: Test Using Postman

Use Postman to test your API endpoints by sending requests to create, read, update, and delete entities.

### Step 10: Run Your Application

Run your Spring Boot application. The server will start at `http://localhost:8080`.
